When network problems strike, one of the fastest ways to understand what’s really happening is by diving into packet captures. That’s where **tcpdump** comes in — a simple yet powerful command-line utility that lets you capture, filter, and analyze packets directly from your terminal. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to use tcpdump to inspect network activity, identify key traffic patterns, and interpret results.

## Install tcpdump
Check whether tcpdump is installed on your machine. Use the command `which tcpdump`.
If not, install it: `sudo apt install tcpdump` for Ubuntu environment.
